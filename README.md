# Image-Caption-Generator-using-CNN-RNN
The goal of this project is to automatically generate natural language captions for images. This involves extracting visual features from images using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and generating relevant text descriptions using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
